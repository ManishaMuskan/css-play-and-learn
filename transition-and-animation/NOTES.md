# Transition

Its's like from initial state to final state.
eg: changing something in hover state. After removing from state it goes back to the initial state within same transition time in reverse state.

# Animation

In this key frames are defined from initial state to final state and in-between multiple other stages can also be defined. It gives better control. This transition happens within the duration defined and then again it takes the initial state. This can be used to control on how any element should come into the view and settle into a final state.
eg: div appearing by sliding up
